GeckoGeoDome
==========

The Idea:

- A geodesic dome structure
- 12v power grid
- Solar powered battery charger
- One week without maintenence
- Positive air pressure interior
- Minimal components

Things this won't do:

- Generate power for a whole camp
- Manage the power for a whole camp
- Completely fall apart without positive air pressure

Moonshot ideas:

- A base and top that zip together over the dome for instant assembly
- Support a wifi access point for a local camp 'net
- Support a small low energy server
- APRS reporting
- Spring loaded dome assembly
